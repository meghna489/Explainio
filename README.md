# Explainio - Explainable AI for Transparent Decision-Making

## 🚀 Overview
Explainio is an **Explainable AI (XAI) framework** designed to make AI-driven decisions **transparent, interpretable, and trustworthy**. Whether it's approving a loan, diagnosing a disease, or making critical predictions, Explainio ensures that users understand the **"why" behind AI decisions**.

## 🔥 Key Features
- **Justification Engine** 🏗️ - Provides clear, human-readable explanations for AI outputs.
- **Glass-Box Models** 🔍 - Uses decision trees, rule-based AI, and interpretable deep learning models.
- **SHAP & LIME Integration** 📊 - Generates feature importance explanations.
- **Audit Logs** 📝 - Keeps track of decisions for compliance and debugging.
- **Customizable Transparency Levels** ⚙️ - Choose how much detail to show users.
- **Bias Detection** ⚖️ - Identifies and mitigates AI biases for fairer outcomes.

## 🎯 Use Cases
✅ **Finance** - Loan approvals with explainable risk assessments.  
✅ **Healthcare** - Transparent AI-based disease diagnosis.  
✅ **HR & Recruitment** - Fair AI-driven hiring decisions.  
✅ **Legal & Compliance** - Ensuring AI decisions meet ethical standards.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Languages**: Python, JavaScript  
- **Libraries**: SHAP, LIME, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL / MongoDB  
- **Frameworks**: Flask / FastAPI (Backend), React (Frontend)  
- **Deployment**: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS/GCP  

## 🚀 Getting Started
### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ankit2061/Explainio.git
cd Explainio
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Run the Application
```bash
python app.py
```

## 🧠 How It Works
1. **AI makes a prediction** (e.g., "Loan Rejected").  
2. **Explainio generates an explanation** (e.g., "Income below threshold, high debt-to-income ratio").  
3. **User sees clear justifications** and can request further details.  
4. **System logs decision** for future audits.  

## 🏗️ Roadmap
- [ ] Implement a user-friendly dashboard for explanations.  
- [ ] Support additional XAI techniques (e.g., Counterfactuals, Anchors).  
- [ ] Improve bias detection and mitigation.
